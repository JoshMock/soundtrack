# Soundtrack

Concept: using WebRTC and the Web Audio API, take input from a user's camera
and generate synthesized audio based on the current camera frame's properties
(brightness, color profile, etc.).

Right now it's very rudementary, but everything starts somewhere.

## Running locally

1. run `npm install` to install packages and build minified source
2. run `npm start`
3. browse to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
4. Turn down your speakers/headphones *JUST IN CASE*.
5. Allow access to your camera.
6. Listen, fiddle with your camera, enjoy.
